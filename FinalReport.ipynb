    "*Note to Team: this was copy pasted from our proposal*\n",
    "\n",
    "Space, and more specifically low-earth orbit, is about to get a whole lot busier and this is making many concerned.  At present, there are about 2,000 operational satellites in low-earth orbit and more than double that in defunct satellites.  But last year in October, SpaceX requested permission to launch 30,000 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit.  This is in addition to the 12,000 that already received approval.  These satellites have already begun interrupting astronomical observations, creating light pollution and increasing collision risks in an environment where a collision could trigger a chain reaction which not only endangers current and future satellites but also human lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking into the present situation with satellite counts, ownership, purpose, and their corresponding orbits.  We will use visualization techniques such as spatial density charts, gabbard diagrams, and animated time series charts to illustrate orbital congestion and highlight intersecting orbits that have the potential for collision.  In addition to satellite data, we will explore debris in space.  Using this data, we intend to investigate several questions and present an analysis that can be used for future work."
