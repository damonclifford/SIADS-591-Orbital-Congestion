    "\n",
    "Space, and more specifically low-earth orbit, is about to get a whole lot busier and this is making many concerned.  At present, there are about 2,000 operational satellites in low-earth orbit and more than double that in defunct satellites.  But last year in October, SpaceX requested permission to launch 30,000 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit.  This is in addition to the 12,000 that already received approval.  These satellites have already begun interrupting astronomical observations, creating light pollution and increasing collision risks in an environment where a collision could trigger a chain reaction which not only endangers current and future satellites but also human lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking into the present situation with satellite counts, ownership, purpose, and their corresponding orbits.  We will use visualization techniques such as spatial density charts, gabbard diagrams, and animated time series charts to illustrate orbital congestion and highlight intersecting orbits that have the potential for collision.  In addition to satellite data, we will explore debris in space.  Using this data, we intend to investigate several questions and present an analysis that can be used for future work."

    "### A. SOCRATES Web Scrapper\n",
    "#### SOCRATES Scrapper\n",
    "[SOCRATES](https://celestrak.com/SOCRATES/) is a web service provided to the satellite community by the Center for Space Standards & Innovation (CSSI) which provides information on pending intercepts of satellites within a week.  This information is valuable for predicting if and when two satellites collide based on probability and estimated minimal distance.\n",
    "To capture this information, a web scrapper called [`socrates_scrapper_nm.py`](job/socrates/nm_win/socrates_scrapper_nm.py) was developed using the `BeautifulSoup` python package.  The web data is tabularized and contains a single conjunction event across two rows which made using pandas built-in scrapper less reliable:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/socrates_raw.png\" alt=\"SOCRATES Webpage Data\" style=\"width: 75%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Twice a day, the information is updated and produces a massive amount of data, therefore, SOCRATES provides three different methods for retrieval [Maximum Probability, Minimum Range, Start Time].  And the maximum number of rows retrieved for each is 1000 events.  Because of this, the web scrapper loops three times capturing the maximum amount of data.\n",
    "The scrapper was written to run as a background job with print messages sent to a log file.  Each execution of the scrapping job dumps the results into a new dataframe which is then saved in `./data/socrates/socrates_YYYYMMDDHHMISS.csv.gz`.  The resulting structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/socrates_scrapper_output.png\" alt=\"SOCRATES Extracted Data\" style=\"width: 90%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting TLE data\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal was to visualize the close encounters reported by SOCRATES in an effective way.  To accomplish this, the TLE for each satellite is necessary.  Getting the latest TLE for a satellite results in a large margin of error which is one of the reasons why TLEs are frequently updated.   Space-Track.org has a retrieval class called `gp_history` for historical TLE records that was used for this data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges in accessing the historic TLE data is that the API used to retrieve `gp_history` data is limited to 300 requests per hour.  While exceeding it is possible and was done initially, Space-Track.org sends an email warning that repeated violations result in a permanent ban.  Since each SOCRATES grab resulted in 3000 satellite pairs twice a day, creativity was necessary to grab the data in larger chunks and thus limiting the number of requests.  This was accomplished by looking at all the SOCRATES data and comparing that to the TLE data previously retrieved and getting a list of missing (new) satellite pairs.  Each satellite then needed an epoch date—the date of when a TLE was captured—to know which TLE should be retrieved from `gp_history`.  SOCRATES didn’t contain this date but instead contained a “Days Since Epoch” value allowing for the backdate calculation.  This unfortunately had an error of about five minutes but TLEs are at most captured every 30 minutes and usually are hours or days apart for one satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the soft cap of 300 requests an hour, the missing data was sorted by epoch date and grouped in batches of approximately 100 and assigned a bin number.  Each bin would represent a single request.  The request was then built passing a list of satellite NORAD ID numbers that existed in the batch and a start/end epoch window.  This could result in the API returning multiple TLEs for the same satellite so the results needed to compare the epoch on the TLE to the approximate epoch calculated previously. The captured TLEs were saved off to a CSV as a safe guard if the merging process should fail so another API grab wouldn’t be necessary (this redundancy was never needed).  The merging process consolidated each satellite pair with their TCA (time of closest approach) and appended the data to the TLE grab dataframe which would later be joined on demand with the SOCRATES data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this TLE grab and merging takes place in a script called [`socrates_gp_history_tle_grab_nm.py`]().  This script was executed after each run of the web scrapper via a background job on a personal computer left on for about two months.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sample_run3.png\" alt=\"Sample Scrapper Run\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example manual run.  The first stage is the web scrapper which sends the output to a log file `log.log`.  The second stage is the TLE grab shows the grab of 4502 missing TLE entries were grouped into 46 API requests and then after merged with the SOCRATES TCA for each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOCRATES Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the raw SOCRATES data contains many duplicates, there might be cases where the raw data might be analyzed without and other cases where only the unique records joined with TLE entries would be necessary.  To resolve this challenge, a new python package `socrates` was created with several different options for loading the SOCRATES data. Those functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_data()` - This loads only the raw SOCRATES data from all available files and merging them together without any cleaning of duplicate records.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` - This calls `get_all_socrates_data(path)` and drops duplicates, keeping only the most recent.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` - This merges the SOCRATES dataset (e.g. from `get_socrates_cleaned_data()`) with the TLE data grabbed for SOCRATES.\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_and_tle_data()` - This calls `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` and `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` and returns two datasets: the cleaned SOCRATES data and the merged data.\n",

    "<a id=\"dm-breakup-pdf\"></a>\n",
    "### B. Satellite Break-Up PDF\n",
    "One issue with the data from Space-Track.org is the origin date of debris resulting from the breakup of satellites is the date the debris is first tracked and not the date of the satellite breakup. Tracking the date of breakup events is crucial to analyze the number of debris available over time as it provides accurate information on when debris were created and subsequently decayed. This information can be found in the form of tables from a PDF report called \"History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations\" from NASA. \n",
    "\n",
    "To extract table information from the PDF, a library named Tabula was used:\n",
    "- Install and set up Tabula (windows): Pip install tabula-py and java. If there’s a `FileNotFoundError` when it calls read_pdf(), set PATH environment variable to point to the Java directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The challenge of using Tabula comes from not reading the tables in PDF file according to the original page breaks. Tabula breaks 8 tables in 8 different pages into 20 dataframes which need to be manually cleaned and combined. In other words, if the satellite name spans multiple rows, Tabula splits it incorrectly into two rows, resulting in a second row with NaNs. Manual cleaning also involves update date format not recognized (i.e. 3/4Aug-15, ~21-Dec-11), removing footnotes and unnamed columns. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"dm-cesium\"></a>\n",
    "### C. Satellite CZML Generator for Cesium\n",
    "\n",
    "CesiumJS is an open-source GPL library that looks similar to Google Earth.  It is highly customizable and allows for painting of custom shapes and images onto and around a 3D model of the Earth built from satellite imagery.  Since the imagery is licensed, a free API key is necessary to create the visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Cesium to display properly on the Plotly Dash dashboard turned out to be challenging due to how Dash creates the different objects and calls javascript methods.  After asking on Plotly Dash community pages and stackeoverflow, help was [received](https://community.plotly.com/t/adding-cesium-app-to-plotly-dash-doesnt-work/48336) on how to get around this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cesium platform also supports a file format called CZML, used to create time-based animations.  To take advantage of this, the python package [`tle2czml`](https://pypi.org/project/tle2czml/), developed by [Shane Carty](https://pypi.org/user/kujosHeist/), was initially used to animate the intercepts of two satellites on the dashboard.  However, this package is quite limited in functionality.  For example, the coloring, markers, and marker descriptions are all static.  An improvement to allow custom descriptions was made and a [pull request](https://github.com/kujosHeist/tle2czml/pull/7) was initialized but the developer hasn’t responded at the time of this writing.  Because of these limitations, a custom python library called `satellite_czml` was created, which is now available as [a python package available on PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/satellite-czml/) and is [open source on Github](https://github.com/cassova/satellite-czml).  The packge can be installed by calling the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install satellite-czml\n",
    "    \n",
    "This python package, like `tle2czml`, relies on a custom version of another python package called [`czml`](https://pypi.org/project/czml/), developed by [Christian Ledermann](https://pypi.org/user/Christian.Ledermann/) and the python package [`spg4`](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/), developed by [Brandon Rhodes](https://pypi.org/user/brandonrhodes/) (coincidently, the same developer of `skyfield`, discussed below).  `satellite_czml` is now used in the dashboard to create the intercept and starlink animations.\n",

    "### D. Downloading Satellite `gp_history` Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Manual Download Process\n",
    "Space-Track provides a `gp_history` API for accessing its all historical satellite TLE data.  For our initial exploration and static charts, we made use of that and manually downloaded individual CSV files from the `gp_history` request class ([request classes documentation](https://www.space-track.org/documentation#api-restRulesAPIClasses)).  However, this process becomes much more tedious when we begin to explore satellite maneuvers and compare multiple satellites across different time periods using `gp_history`.  With other analysis also using `gp_history` to various extents, an automated processes to acquire bulk data became a necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Up Automatic Downloads\n",
    "Some challenges that we had to overcome in order for us to perform the bulk downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Description and resolution |\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "| *API limitations* | The API has a hard limit of 100,000 entries per request and a rate limit of 30/minute and 300/hour.  With the `gp_history` data sitting at nearly 150 million entries, under optimal situations we would still need a process in place to make 1,500 API calls over a period of 5 hours at the minimum. |\n",
    "| *API authentication* | The API requires authentication using username and password, but we had personal accounts and we did not want credentials to be shared in the git repository.  We shared a credentials template file in our git repository and had a local credentials file to be used (git ignored). |\n",
    "| *Authorization duration* | The API only offers access tokens with 2 hour lifetime, with the large amount of long running jobs, we needed to reuse and automatically re-authenticate automatically whenever necessary. |\n",
    "| *Platform support* | An ideal long term solution should be cross-platform as our local development machines were Windows and Mac OS.  A method to have a jupyter notebook automatically run code was developed to avoid platform specific schedulers or a separate backend (see `playground/tim_autorun-notebook/skeleton_autorun_below.ipynb` for proof of concept and skeleton code). |\n",
    "| *Keeping data up to date* | The process must allow incremental updates when new data becomes available while ensuring that no entries are missed. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the script only downloaded satellite data with various LEO configurations in chronological order, however, sometimes data entries will be missing or spiky when specific parameters cross the certain thresholds (i.e.: the LEO requirements). Ultimately, the script was modified to download practically all of the data with local filtering being performed based on specific data needs at a later time.  The current numbers as of Jan 26th, 2021: 144,800,000+ `gp_history` entries stored in 1,449 files, taking up 80GB storage.  These raw files are then compressed and stored without further processing as different analysis may require different columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this download process can be found at `playground/tim_fetch/download_all_gp_history.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"dm-maneuver\"></a>\n",
    "### E. Detection of Orbital Maneuvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Maneuver detection is possible by looking at abnormal readings in the TLE data.  Initially, we just downloaded CSV files from Space-Track directly using the query builder to look at all orbital elements that could change for possible clues on when a satellite maneuvered.  Visually, it was easy to identify these maneuvers, however, with the availability of the entire `gp_history` dataset, it was not as straightforward to programatically identify them automatically at scale.  This section will provide an overview of how the data is pre-processed.  Maneuver detection methods will be discussed in the analysis section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges Encountered for Automatic Orbital Maneuver Detection \n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Description |\n",
    "|:--|:--|\n",
    "| *Data Frequency* | Interval between TLE entries can varies a lot - from 1 entry in 3 months to less than 2 hours between 2 TLEs.  Some normalization is needed when using `.diff()` to examine the data. |\n",
    "| *Data Accuracy* | Some data contains obvoius errors which may be due to sensor errors or attributing TLE data to the wrong entity.  There are also some duplicates in data that affects rolling windows using `.rolling()` and using `.diff()` to look at changes in data. |\n",
    "| *Memory Requirements* | Due to the size of the data, loading in all the data has a really high memory demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reducing Orbital Elements Used\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining ISS's orbit data, it appears that some of the orbital elements have direct correlation (such as `MEAN_MOTION`, `SEMIMAJOR_AXIS`, `PERIOD`, `APOAPSIS`, and `PERIAPSIS`, as well as `BSTAR` and `MEAN_MOTION_DOT`) while others are less suitable due to their periodic variance and noise (such as `ECCENTRICITY`, `ARG_OF_PERICENTER`, and `MEAN_ANOMALY`).\n",

    "![iss_maneuver.png](images/iss_maneuver.png)\n",
    "<center>ISS orbital elements from TLE entries during a period between 2014 and 2016</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After further research ([source, NASA - Satellite Safety](https://satellitesafety.gsfc.nasa.gov/maneuvers.html)) revealed that satellites mainly maneuver by raising or lowering their orbits, or adjusting their inclination, it was decided to only look at `SEMIMAJOR_AXIS` and `INCLINATION` to determine orbital maneuvers.  This resulted in a reduction of 9 columns from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reducing Memory Footprint via `dtype` Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with over 32,147,425 rows of TLE data for the artficial satellites, it still took up significant memory and further reduction was preferred.  With the data being stored as 64 bit numbers, we expored using 32 bit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column | Import `dtype` | Notes | Final `dtype` conversion |\n",
    "|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n",
    "| EPOCH | `object` | While we could have used another data type instead of `datetime64` that represented a custom time representation, we did not use this approach as it would make data exploration a lot more tedius.  Also of note that a 32bit representation would likely lead to the smallest time step in seconds, which could potentially be a problem when exploring maneuver some collision predictions put satellites in the same block of space with in milliseconds of each other. | `datetime64` |\n",
    "| NORAD_CAT_ID | `int64` | A NORAD ID is assigned to each piece of space object.  Currently, artificial satellites have NORAD IDs up to the 47,000 NORAD IDs range, making the unsigned 16-bit integer `uint16` a perfect choice for the near term*.   | `uint16`\n",
    "| INCLINATION | `float64` | Inclination has a value range of 0-180.  Initially we considered `float32` for an easy conversion, however it introduced precision loss.  Noticing that Space-Track provides the data with a maximum of 5 decimal point precision.  We decided to process and store the value in a `uint32` after multiplying it by 10,000. | `uint32` <br /><br />With 10,000x scaling |\n",
    "| SEMIMAJOR_AXIS | `float64` | We gave Semimajor Axis a similar treatment to Inclination, noticing that it only has a maximum of 4 decimal point precision. | `uint32` <br /><br />With 1,000x scaling |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note *: While `uint16` should be sufficient to represent `NORAD_CAT_ID` for our purposes, it is important to keep in mind that 80,000-89,999 range is assigned to objects with insufficient fidelity for publication in the public satellite catalog ([source, Space-Track FAQ](https://www.space-track.org/documentation#faq)), and that the SATCAT is growing at a much quicker rate compared to before.  The Combined Force Space Component Command also has increased tracking capacity with the introduction of a new Space Fence on Kwajalein Atoll in March 2020.  With over 200 objects being added to the SATCAT in Jan, 2021 already, we may be reaching the maximum allowable value for `uint16` of `65535` rather soon (currently at 47,436 as of writing).*\n",

    "### F. Looking for Risk Mitigation Maneuvers\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the questions that we wanted to answer was whether satellites were maneuvering more frequently with the increasing amount of satellites in Low Earth Orbit to avoid potential collisions.  To achieve this, we turn to the CelesTrak Satellite Orbital Conjunction Reports Assessing Threatening Encounters in Space (SOCRATES) dataset.  SOCRATES uses the same TLE data available from Space-Track to provide us with data on potential satellite conjunctions for a 7 day period.  With the SOCRATES data, we are able to identify pairs of satellites on a collision course (can be visualized in the [dashboard](https://oc-dash.herokuapp.com/)), however, the information is limited to a specific time.  In order to detect maneuver, a series of TLE data surrounding the conjunction time is required.  We also want to group the predictions made during different times for the same incident together to get an idea of how the collision probability has changed during that 7 day period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining and Grouping SOCRATES Entries\n",
    "To get the SOCRATES history of a particular possible collision, we first combine all the SOCRATES reports into one DataFrame.  SOCRATES entries are grouped together based on the satellite pairing and the Time of Closest Approach (`tca_time`).  Additional data manipulation was needed to set the proper group for `tca_time` due to pairs of satellites having multiple conjunction events.  To filter it down our selection further, we eliminate entries which only contain objects that no longer maneuver, such as debris or spent rocket bodies.  We also filter for LEO objects only as that is the scope of our project.  Finally, we take a look at only events with a `max_prob` predicted change greater than 0.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the maneuver dataset process already completed in [the previous section](#dm-maneuver), we only needed to load that dataset and apply the appropriate `NORAD_CAT_ID` and `EPOCH` time range filter.  For the time range, we have chosen to include data 14 days prior to the first time a conjunction event was predicted and 5 days after the `tca_time`, to provide the maneuver detection algorithm plenty of data to find maneuvers and for us to visualize individual events with context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite catalog (SATCAT) was also merged to provide names of the satellites since that was removed from an earlier reduction process.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Grouping Data for each Animation Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof of concept for the animation was done using a small timeframe by grouping entries using the `dt.week`.  This was not an ideal solution though, because week numbers do not reset with a year change, resulting in a flashback frame every year, and none of the aggregate features represented the satelite's position well due to how wide the time window was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a datetime `groupby` cannot be used, we had to turn to `reindex` and `interpolate` to have a more accurate representation of the data.  A proof of concept was done by first performing a `unstack` so each satellite has its own column, then performing a reindex over the entire time period and interpolate missing data in between.  However, this failed to scale spectacularly as the DataFrame size is now `m` * `n` where `m` is the number of objects * 3 (one for each of `PERIOD`,  `APOAPSIS`, and `PERIAPSIS`) and `n` is the number of frames - exceeding billions of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate strategy was developed, where each satellite would only generate its own valid time range in order to avoid the `NaN` cells prior to the it being tracked or after it decayed.  This was achieved by performing the split-apply-combine process, grouping by `NORAD_CAT_ID` then applying the datetime index transformation along with the interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying `dtype` Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce memory usage, `dtype` conversion was applied.  What is different between the Gabbard diagram and the maneuver detection data is that a Gabbard diagram can allow for some precision loss that can hardly be noticed due to the limited size of the charting area.  This allows us to do some clever steps when looking for a suitable `dtype` to use.  The `dtype` conversion will be applied prior to grouping and interpolation.  Every little *bit* (Ba Dum Tss!) counts with the with 86,326,993 rows of data!\n",

    "The amount of debris in orbit has been increasing since 1958. The rate of growth slowed for a decade from 1996. However, the destruction of the Fengyun-1C weather satellite in 2007 and the collision of the inactive Russian satellite Cosmos and the active U.S.-based communication satellite Iridium in 2009 reversed that trend, creating at least 4000 pieces of debris. As a result, it increased the risk of impacts to the ISS by an estimated 44 percent over a 10-day period.

According to NASA, most “space junk” can reach a speed of 18,000 miles per hour, almost seven times faster than a bullet[<sup>link2</sup>](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/library/find/bibliographies/space_debris).

    "To effectively visualize the orbits and intercepts of satellites, several options for presenting 3D visuals were researched.  Matplotlib and Plotly both provide 3D plotting functionality and are common libraries used in Python, although, matplotlib lacks the interactivity necessary to navigate a satellite orbit.  Because of this Plotly was first utilized.\n",
    "Plotly does have the capability for painting an image onto a 3D surface but only one color channel can be applied.  Also, since Plotly is utilizing functionality not designed to paint 3D surfaces with images, the image resolution must be kept at a minimum to improve performance.  In the end, a black and white, stereographic image of the earth was used to create an earth-like sphere.  To place a satellite marker on the Plotly 3D image, the Python package [`skyfield`](https://pypi.org/project/skyfield/) was used which offers the `EarthSatellite()` convenience function and outputs an x,y,z coordinate in kilometers with the center of the earth as the origin.\n",

The amount of data necessary to plot over 20,000 satellites using a CZML string was slow and the amount of data too large for a timely response.  Using Javascript methods to calculate position instead of using CZML would have likely been a more suitable approach but this was abandoned due to time restraints in favor of using a 3D Plotly visual.

    "In order to perform analysis on whether a satellite performed a risk mitigation maneuver (RMM) or not, we must first be able to detect when a satellite made any maneuvers.  Artificial satellites with propulsion can adjust their orbit by performing two types of maneuvers.  The first is a orbit raising/lowering maneuver, where orbit raising is normally performed to counter the effects of atmosphere drag or to avoid other satellites.  Orbit lowering maneuvers are sometimes performed by braking instead during RMMs if an orbit raising maneuver is not an option.  The second type of maneuver is an inclination adjustment maneuver where the inclination is adjusted to keep the orbit within certain parameters ([source, NASA - Satellite Safety](https://satellitesafety.gsfc.nasa.gov/maneuvers.html)).  We will be examining the semimajor axis and inclination metrics of 8 selected satellites to see if we correctly detect the maneuvers.  For simplicity, we will be looking at at data in isolation.\n",

    "Collisions between objects in space are hypervelocity collisions where the velocity (v) of the impactor (relative to the target) is so great that its kinetic energy ( $K = \\frac{m v^2}{2}$) is greater than the energy released in the detonation of the same mass (m) of high explosive.[<sup>link3</sup>](https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/collision.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "In low Earth orbit, the velocity of a satellite is between 7 and 8 km/sec and the typical collision velocity between two space objects in LEO is around 10 km/sec. Most accidental LEO collisions are hypervelocity collisions. The deliberate destruction of a satellite with a launched missile is also a hypervelocity collision. A hypervelocity collision may be categorised as catastrophic or non-catastrophic. A catastrophic impact results in both the target and the impactor being totally destroyed while in a non-catastrophic event, the impactor is detroyed and the target is damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment ejected from the collision will have a new orbit dependent upon the magnitude of the ejection velocity and the direction of this velocity vector with respect to the velocity vector of the satellite at the time of collision. If the velocity is in the same direction as the original target motion (A), the initial orbit will be turned into a larger elliptial orbit. On the other hand, if the velocity is in the opposite direction (B), the final orbit will become smaller than initail orbit. This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

    "#### Gabbard Diagram\n",
    "John Gabbard developed a diagram for illustrating the orbital changes and the orbital decay of debris fragments. A Gabbard diagram is a scatter plot of height versus period. The apogee and perigee of each ejected fragment is shown as a point on the diagram. \n",

    "#### FengYun-1C Anti-satellite Missile Test\n",
    "On 11 January 2007, a non-operational Chinese weather satellite, the Fengyun-1C (FY-1C) was destroyed by a payload (a kinetic kill vehicle) traveling with a speed of 8 km/s in the opposite direction at an altitude of 863 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below Gabbard diagram illustrates the aftermath of this collision: \n",
    "1) 3526 pieces of debris of trackable sizes are documented and 646 have decayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The cross sign (x) marks the location of collision at the altitude of 863km which is low earth orbit(LEO). when a collision happens at a low altitude, some of the fragments ejected in the opposite direction to the original motion will be forced into orbits with a perigee below the Earth's surface. As a result, these fragments with smaller mass will generally burn up during reentry. Those of bigger mass tend to decay later due to atmospheric drag.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fragments with a perigee of less than about 100 km will encounter so much air resistance that they will never make it back to apogee, and will deorbit in less than one period. This explains the decay objects on the bottom left of the graph (purple and orange points) and the progessive drop in apogee as the period gets smaller.\n",

    "#### Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251\n",
    "On 10 February 2009, the Iridium 33 satellite collided with Kosmos-2251 causing massive debris clouds to form.  To see if Cesium could be used to visualize this impact, the TLE data was gathered for the satellites just prior and after the collision.  The resulting simulation successfully showed the two satellites paths intersecting in the artic circle.\n",

    "<center>Iridium-33 and Kosmos-2251 Collision Point</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the TLE data for each piece of debris was collected.  Knowing that the TLE data for each piece of debris was collected after the collision, in some cases months after the collision, the debris position needed to be back dated to the time of the collision which would undoutably contain some error.  After calculating the debris position at the time of collision using the first available TLE, Cesium showed debris scattered along each orbit instead of centered on the point of collision.  The true error in the TLE data was overwhelming to the point that this exercise was scrapped.\n",
