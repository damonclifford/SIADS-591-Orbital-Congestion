    "Space, and more specifically low-earth orbit, is about to get a whole lot busier and this is making many concerned.  At present, there are about 2,000 operational satellites in low-earth orbit and more than double that in defunct satellites.  But last year in October, SpaceX requested permission to launch 30,000 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit.  This is in addition to the 12,000 that already received approval.  These satellites have already begun interrupting astronomical observations, creating light pollution and increasing collision risks in an environment where a collision could trigger a chain reaction which not only endangers current and future satellites but also human lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking into the present situation with satellite counts, ownership, purpose, and their corresponding orbits.  We will use visualization techniques such as spatial density charts, gabbard diagrams, and animated time series charts to illustrate orbital congestion and highlight intersecting orbits that have the potential for collision.  In addition to satellite data, we will explore debris in space.  Using this data, we intend to investigate several questions and present an analysis that can be used for future work."

    "#### SOCRATES Scrapper\n",
    "<a href=\"https://celestrak.com/SOCRATES/\" target=\"_blank\">SOCRATES</a> is a web service provided to the satellite community by the Center for Space Standards & Innovation (CSSI) which provides information on pending intercepts of satellites within a week.  This information is valuable for predicting if and when two satellites collide based on probability and estimated minimal distance.\n",
    "To capture this information, a web scrapper called <a href=\"https://github.com/mads-hatters/SIADS-591-Orbital-Congestion/blob/main/job/socrates/nm_win/socrates_scrapper_nm.py\" target=\"_blank\"><code>socrates_scrapper_nm.py</code></a> was developed using the `BeautifulSoup` python package.  The web data is tabularized and contains a single conjunction event across two rows which made using pandas built-in scrapper less reliable:\n",
    "\n",

    "<span style=\"text-align:center;display:block\"><img src=\"images/socrates_raw.png\" alt=\"SOCRATES Webpage Data\" style=\"width: 75%;\"/></span>\n",

    "Twice a day, the information is updated and produces a massive amount of data, therefore, SOCRATES provides three different methods for retrieval [Maximum Probability, Minimum Range, Start Time].  And the maximum number of rows retrieved for each is 1000 events.  Because of this, the web scrapper loops three times capturing the maximum amount of data.\n",
    "The scrapper was written to run as a background job with output messages sent to a log file.  Each execution of the scrapping job dumps the results into a new dataframe which is then saved in `./data/socrates/socrates_YYYYMMDDHHMISS.csv.gz`.  The resulting structure:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Getting TLE data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals was to visualize the close encounters reported by SOCRATES in an effective way.  To accomplish this, the TLE for each satellite is necessary.  Getting the latest TLE for a satellite results in a large margin of error which is one of the reasons why TLEs are frequently updated.   Space-Track.org has a retrieval class called `gp_history` for historical TLE records that was used for this data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges in accessing the historic TLE data is that the API used to retrieve `gp_history` data is limited to 300 requests per hour.  While exceeding it is possible and was done initially, Space-Track.org sends an email warning that repeated violations result in a permanent ban.  Since each SOCRATES grab resulted in 3000 satellite pairs twice a day, creativity was necessary to grab the data in larger chunks and thus limiting the number of requests.  This was accomplished by looking at all the SOCRATES data and comparing that to the TLE data previously retrieved and getting a list of missing (new) satellite pairs.  Each satellite then needed an epoch date—the date of when a TLE was captured—to know which TLE should be retrieved from `gp_history`.  SOCRATES didn’t contain this date but instead contained a “Days Since Epoch” value allowing for the backdate calculation.  This unfortunately had an error of about five minutes but TLEs are at most captured every 30 minutes and usually are hours or days apart for one satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the soft cap of 300 requests an hour, the missing data was sorted by epoch date and grouped in batches of approximately 100 and assigned a bin number.  Each bin would represent a single request.  The request was then built passing a list of satellite NORAD ID numbers that existed in the batch and a start/end epoch window.  This could result in the API returning multiple TLEs for the same satellite so the results needed to compare the epoch on the TLE to the approximate epoch calculated previously. The captured TLEs were saved off to a CSV as a safe guard if the merging process should fail so another API grab wouldn’t be necessary (this redundancy was never needed).  The merging process consolidated each satellite pair with their TCA (time of closest approach) and appended the data to the TLE grab dataframe which would later be joined on demand with the SOCRATES data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this TLE grab and merging takes place in a script called <a href=\"https://github.com/mads-hatters/SIADS-591-Orbital-Congestion/blob/main/job/socrates/nm_win/socrates_gp_history_tle_grab_nm.py\" target=\"_blank\"><code>socrates_gp_history_tle_grab_nm.py</code></a>.  This script was executed after each run of the web scrapper via a background job on a personal computer left on for about two months.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"text-align:center;display:block\"><img src=\"images/sample_run3.png\" alt=\"Sample Scrapper Run\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example manual run.  The first stage is the web scrapper which sends the output to a log file `log.log`.  The second stage is the TLE grab shows the grab of 4502 missing TLE entries grouped into 46 API requests and then after merged with the SOCRATES TCA for each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOCRATES Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the raw SOCRATES data contains many duplicates, there might be cases where the raw data might be analyzed and other cases where only the unique records joined with TLE entries would be necessary.  To resolve this challenge, a new python package <a href=\"https://github.com/mads-hatters/SIADS-591-Orbital-Congestion/blob/main/pkg/orbital_congestion/socrates.py\" target=\"_blank\"><code>socrates</code></a> was created with several different options for loading the SOCRATES data. Those functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_data()` - This loads only the raw SOCRATES data from all available files and merging them together without any cleaning of duplicate records.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` - This calls `get_all_socrates_data(path)` and drops duplicates, keeping only the most recent.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` - This merges the SOCRATES dataset (e.g. from `get_socrates_cleaned_data()`) with the TLE data grabbed for SOCRATES.\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_and_tle_data()` - This calls `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` and `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` and returns two datasets: the cleaned SOCRATES data and the merged data."

    "One issue with the data from Space-Track.org is the origin date of debris resulting from the breakup of satellites is the date the debris is first tracked and not the date of the satellite breakup. Tracking the date of breakup events is crucial to analyze the number of debris available over time as it provides accurate information on when debris were created and subsequently decayed. This information can be found in the form of tables from a PDF report called \"History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations\" from NASA. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The challenge of using Tabula comes from not reading the tables in PDF file according to the original page breaks. Tabula breaks 8 tables in 8 different pages into 20 dataframes which need to be manually cleaned and combined. In other words, if the satellite name spans multiple rows, Tabula splits it incorrectly into two rows, resulting in a second row with NaNs. Manual cleaning also involves update date format not recognized (i.e. 3/4Aug-15, ~21-Dec-11), removing footnotes and unnamed columns. "

    "\n",
    "With the increasing amount of satellites in Low Earth Orbit, an increased frequency of risk mitigation maneuvers is expected.  To verify this hypothesis, data from the CelesTrak's SOCRATES dataset was again used.  SOCRATES uses the same TLE data available from Space-Track to calculate potential satellite conjunctions for a 7 day period.  With the SOCRATES data, pairs of satellites on a collision course (can be visualized in the <a href=\"https://oc-dash.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dashboard</a>) were identified, however, the information is limited to a specific time.  In order to detect maneuver, a series of TLE data surrounding the conjunction time is required.  Grouping of the predictions made was also needed to determine how the collision probability has changed during that 7 day period for each incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combining and Grouping SOCRATES Entries\n",
    "To get the SOCRATES history of a particular possible collision, all the SOCRATES reports where combined into one DataFrame then grouped together based on the satellite pairing and the Time of Closest Approach (`tca_time`).  Additional data manipulation was needed to set the proper group for `tca_time` due to pairs of satellites having multiple conjunction events.  To filter down the selection further, entries which only contain objects that are known to have no maneuvering abilities, such as debris or spent rocket bodies, were removed.  Non-LEO objects were also elimited as they were out of scope of the project.  Finally, events with a predicted `max_prob` of 0.5% or greater were selected to do further investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the maneuver dataset process already completed in [the previous section](#dm-maneuver), applying the appropriate `NORAD_CAT_ID` and `EPOCH` time range filter was the only necessary step to obtain the satellite data.  A time range of 14 days prior to the first time a conjunction event was predicted to 5 days after the `tca_time` was chosen to provide the maneuver detection algorithm plenty of data to find maneuvers and to provide context during visual inspection of the individual events.\n",

    "\n",
    "Proof of concept for the animation was done using a small timeframe by grouping entries using the `dt.week`.  This was not an ideal solution though, because week numbers do not reset with a year change, resulting in a flashback frame every year, and none of the aggregate features represented the satelite's position well due to how wide the time window was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a datetime `groupby` cannot be used, `reindex` and `interpolate` were used instead to have a more accurate representation of the data.  A proof of concept was done by first performing a `unstack` so each satellite has its own column, then performing a reindex over the entire time period and interpolate missing data in between.  However, this failed to scale spectacularly as the DataFrame size is now `m` * `n` where `m` is the number of objects * 3 (one for each of `PERIOD`,  `APOAPSIS`, and `PERIAPSIS`) and `n` is the number of frames - exceeding billions of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate strategy was developed, where each satellite would only generate its own valid time range in order to avoid the `NaN` cells prior to the it being tracked or after it decayed.  This was achieved by performing the split-apply-combine process, grouping by `NORAD_CAT_ID` then applying the datetime index transformation along with the interpolation.  Due to some errors in the data in the late 1970s, where incorrect TLEs were being attributed to satellites, it was also necessary to remove some outliers and to not interpolate impossible cases.\n",

However, the destruction of the Fengyun-1C weather satellite in 2007 and the collision of the inactive Russian satellite Cosmos and the active U.S.-based communication satellite Iridium in 2009 reversed that trend, creating at least 4000 pieces of debris. As a result, it increased the risk of impacts to the ISS by an estimated 44 percent over a 10-day period.

The amount of data necessary to plot over 20,000 satellites using a CZML string was slow and the amount of data too large for a timely response.  Using Javascript methods to calculate position instead of using CZML would have likely been a more suitable approach but this was abandoned due to time restraints in favor of using a 3D Plotly visual.

    "####  Collisions\n",
    "Collisions between objects in space are hypervelocity collisions where the velocity (v) of the impactor (relative to the target) is so great that its kinetic energy ( $K = \\frac{m v^2}{2}$) is greater than the energy released in the detonation of the same mass (m) of high explosive. (<a href=\"https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/collision.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Space Academy, ret. 2020</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "In low Earth orbit, the velocity of a satellite is between 7 and 8 km/sec and the typical collision velocity between two space objects in LEO is around 10 km/sec. An accidental LEO collision will most likely be a hypervelocity collision. The deliberate destruction of a satellite with a launched missile is also a hypervelocity collision. A hypervelocity collision may be categorised as catastrophic or non-catastrophic. A catastrophic impact results in both the target and the impactor being totally destroyed while in a non-catastrophic event, the impactor is detroyed and the target is damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragments ejected from a collision will have a new orbit dependent upon the magnitude of the ejection velocity and the direction of this velocity vector with respect to the velocity vector of the satellite at the time of collision. If the velocity is in the same direction as the original target motion (A), the initial orbit will be turned into a larger elliptial orbit. On the other hand, if the velocity is in the opposite direction (B), the final orbit will become smaller than the initial orbit. This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

    "#### Gabbard Diagram\n",
    "John Gabbard developed a diagram for illustrating the orbital changes and the orbital decay of debris fragments. A Gabbard diagram is a scatter plot of orbit altitude versus orbital period. Since all orbits are elliptical, a Gabbard diagram plots two points for each satellite: the apogee and perigee.  Each pair of points will share the same orbital period and thus will be vertically aligned.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### FengYun-1C Anti-satellite Missile Test\n",
    "On 11 January 2007, a non-operational Chinese weather satellite, the Fengyun-1C (FY-1C) was destroyed by a kinetic kill vehicle (missle) traveling with a speed of 8 km/s in the opposite direction at an altitude of 863 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below Gabbard diagram illustrates the aftermath of this collision: \n",
    "1) 3526 pieces of debris of trackable sizes are documented and 646 pieces have decayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The cross sign (x) marks the location of collision at the altitude of 863km which is low earth orbit(LEO).  When a collision happens at a low altitude, some of the fragments ejected in the opposite direction to the original motion will be forced into orbits with a perigee below the Earth's surface. As a result, these fragments with smaller mass will generally burn up during reentry. Those of a larger mass tend to decay later due to their momentum until atmospheric drag causes them to deorbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fragments with a perigee of less than about 100 km will encounter so much air resistance that they will never make it back to apogee, and will deorbit in less than one period. This explains the decay objects on the bottom left of the graph (purple and orange points) and the progessive drop in apogee as the period gets smaller.\n",

To see if Cesium could be used to visualize this impact, the TLE data was gathered for the satellites just prior and after the collision.

    "Next, the TLE data for each piece of debris was collected.  Knowing that the TLE data for each piece of debris was collected after the collision, in some cases months after the collision, the debris position needed to be back dated to the time of the collision which would undoutably contain some error.  After calculating the debris position at the time of collision using the first available TLE, Cesium showed debris scattered along each orbit instead of centered on the point of collision.  The true error in the TLE data was overwhelming to the point that this exercise was scrapped.\n",

Each object is represented by two points in the Gabbard diagram, a lower periapsis point and a higher apoapsis along the same x-axis.

A diagonal border separating the periapsis and apoapsis points formed by circular orbits of varying orbital periods can be seen on the diagram.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some believe that congestion in low Earth orbit will reach a tipping point in the near future, while others believe that the issue is not imminent due to the speed at which objects decay compared to other orbits.  Our analysis found support for both arguments as significant differences in satellite decay speed is observed between lower and higher orbits within LEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the unprecedented launch of satellite constellations planned by SpaceX, OneWeb, Amazon, and other private companies, a multi-faceted approach will be necessary to address the potential of catastrophic events with lasting effect in LEO's higher orbits.  A combination of autonomous collision avoidance systems, new international laws for decommissioning satellites, and new technologies for cleaning up defunct satellites and debris will be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found that meaningful conjunction prediction is no longer possible due to the increasing number of satellites and precision limitations with TLE data.  In future studies, we can leverage machine learning techniques using non-public data provided by US Space Command. If our request was granted, we could more accurately analyze the impact of increasing LEO density on collision probability."
