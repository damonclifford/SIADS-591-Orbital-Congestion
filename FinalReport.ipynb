    "Space, and more specifically low-earth orbit, is about to get a whole lot busier and this is making many concerned.  At present, there are about 2,000 operational satellites in low-earth orbit and more than double that in defunct satellites.  But last year in October, SpaceX requested permission to launch 30,000 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit.  This is in addition to the 12,000 that already received approval.  These satellites have already begun interrupting astronomical observations, creating light pollution and increasing collision risks in an environment where a collision could trigger a chain reaction which not only endangers current and future satellites but also human lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking into the present situation with satellite counts, ownership, purpose, and their corresponding orbits.  We will use visualization techniques such as spatial density charts, gabbard diagrams, and animated time series charts to illustrate orbital congestion and highlight intersecting orbits that have the potential for collision.  In addition to satellite data, we will explore debris in space.  Using this data, we intend to investigate several questions and present an analysis that can be used for future work."

    "#### SOCRATES Scrapper\n",
    "[SOCRATES](https://celestrak.com/SOCRATES/) is a web service provided to the satellite community by the Center for Space Standards & Innovation (CSSI) which provides information on pending intercepts of satellites within a week.  This information is valuable for predicting if and when two satellites collide based on probability and estimated minimal distance.\n",
    "To capture this information, a web scrapper called [`socrates_scrapper_nm.py`](job/socrates/nm_win/socrates_scrapper_nm.py) was developed using the `BeautifulSoup` python package.  The web data is tabularized and contains a single conjunction event across two rows which made using pandas built-in scrapper less reliable:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/socrates_raw.png\" alt=\"SOCRATES Webpage Data\" style=\"width: 75%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Twice a day, the information is updated and produces a massive amount of data so SOCRATES provides three different methods for retrieval [Maximum Probability, Minimum Range, Start Time].  And the maximum number of rows retrieved for each is 1000 events.  Because of this, the web scrapper loops three times capturing the maximum amount of data.\n",
    "The scrapper was written to run as a background job with print messages sent to a log file.  Each execution of the scrapping job dumps the results into a new dataframe which is then saved in `./data/socrates/socrates_YYYYMMDDHHMISS.csv.gz`.  The resulting structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/socrates_scrapper_output.png\" alt=\"SOCRATES Extracted Data\" style=\"width: 90%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting TLE data\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal was to visualize the close encounters reported by SOCRATES in an effective way.  To accomplish this, the TLE for each satellite is necessary.  Getting the latest TLE for a satellite results in a large margin of error which is why TLEs are frequently updated.   Space-Track.org has a retrieval class called `gp_history` for historical TLE records.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges in accessing the historic TLE data is that API used to retrieve `gp_history` data is limited to 100 requests per hour.  While exceeding it is possible and was done initially, Space-Track.org sends an email warning that repeated actions result in a permanent ban.  Since each SOCRATES grab resulted in 3000 satellite pairs twice a day, creativity was necessary to grab the data in larger chunks and thus limiting the number of requests.  This was accomplished by looking at all the SOCRATES data and comparing that to the TLE data we had previously grabbed and getting a list of missing (new) satellite pairs.  Each satellite then needed an epoch date—the date of when a TLE was captured—to know which TLE should be retrieved from `gp_history`.  SOCRATES didn’t contain this date but instead contained a “Days Since Epoch” value allowing for the backdate calculation.  This unfortunately had an error of about five minutes but TLEs are at most captured every 30 minutes and usually are hours or days apart for one satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the soft cap of 100 requests an hour, the missing data was sorted by epoch date and grouped in batches of approximately 100 and assigned a bin number.  Each bin would represent a single request.  The request was then built passing a list of satellite NORAD ID numbers that existed in the batch and a start/end epoch window.  This could result in the API returning multiple TLEs for the same satellite so the results needed to compare the epoch on the TLE to the approximate epoch calculated previously. The captured TLEs were saved off to a CSV as a safe guard if the merging process should fail so another API grab wouldn’t be necessary (this redundancy was never needed).  The merging process consolidated each satellite pair with their TCA (time of closest approach) and appended the data to the TLE grab dataframe which would later be joined on demand with the SOCRATES data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this TLE grab and merging takes place in a script called [`socrates_gp_history_tle_grab_nm.py`]().  This script was executed after each run of the web scrapper via a background job on a personal computer left on for about two months.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sample_run3.png\" alt=\"Sample Scrapper Run\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example run manually.  The first stage is the web scrapper which sends the output to a log file `log.log`.  The second stage is the TLE grab shows the grab of 4502 missing TLE entries were grouped into 46 API requests and then after merged with the SOCRATES TCA for each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOCRATES Python Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the raw SOCRATES data contains many duplicates, there might be cases where the raw data might be analyzed without and other cases where only the unique records joined with TLE entries would be necessary.  To resolve this challenge, a new python package `socrates` was created with several different options for loading the socrates data. Some of those functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_data()` - This loads only the raw SOCRATES data without any cleaning of duplicate records.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` - This calls `get_all_socrates_data(path)` and drops duplicates.\n",
    "- `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` - This merges a SOCRATES dataset with the TLE data.\n",
    "- `get_all_socrates_and_tle_data()` - This calls `get_socrates_cleaned_data()` and `get_socrates_with_tle_data()` and returns two datasets: the cleaned SOCRATES data and the merged data.\n",

It is highly customizable and allows for painting of custom shapes and images onto and around a 3D model of the Earth built from satellite imagery.  Since the imagery is licensed, a free API key is necessary to create the visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Cesium to display properly on the Plotly Dash dashboard turned out to be challenging due to how Dash creates the different objects and calls javascript methods.  After asking on Plotly Dash community pages and stackeoverflow, help was received on how to get around this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cesium platform also supports a file format called CZML, used to create time-based animations.  To take advantage of this, the python package [`tle2czml`](https://pypi.org/project/tle2czml/), developed by [Shane Carty](https://pypi.org/user/kujosHeist/), was initially used to animate the intercepts of two satellites on the dashboard.  However, this package was quite limited in functionality.  For example, the coloring, markers, and marker descriptions were all static.  An improvement to allow custom descriptions was made a pull request was initialized but the developer hasn’t responded at the time of this writing.  Because of these limitations, a custom python library called `satellite_czml` was created, which is now available as [a python package available on PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/satellite-czml/) and is [open source on Github](https://github.com/cassova/satellite-czml).  The packge can be installed by calling the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install satellite-czml\n",

    "This python package, like `tle2czml`, relies on a custom version of another python package called [`czml`](https://pypi.org/project/czml/), developed by [Christian Ledermann](https://pypi.org/user/Christian.Ledermann/) and the python package [`spg4`](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/), developed by [Brandon Rhodes](https://pypi.org/user/brandonrhodes/) (coincidently, the same developer of `skyfield`, discussed below).  `satellite_czml` is now used in the dashboard to create the intercept and starlink animations."

    "In the past 60 years, the space around the Earth has gone from a virtually debris-free environment to a zone cluttered with man-made objects that potentially threaten launches, active satellites, and the International Space Station (ISS). Below time series graph illustrate the historical growth of space debris including rocket body as well as payload (i.e. satellite and spacecraft).\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of debris in orbit has been increasing since 1958. The rate of growth slowed for a decade from 1996. However, the destruction of the Fengyun-1C weather satellite in 2007 and the collision of the inactive Russian satellite Cosmos and the active U.S.-based communication satellite Iridium in 2009 reversed that trend, creating at least 4000 pieces of debris. As a result, it increased the risk of impacts to the ISS by an estimated 44 percent over a 10-day period[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1).\n",

Evidently, low-earth orbit (LEO) has the highest objects count among all orbits stated. In 2020, approximately 80% of space objects are in LEO. LEO has become an orbital space junk yard. According to NASA, most “space junk” can reach a speed of 18,000 miles per hour, almost seven times faster than a bullet[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2). Due to the rate of speed and the increasing number of debris in LEO, current and future space-based activities pose a safety risk to people and property in space and on Earth. The problem of managing space debris is every spacefaring country's responsibility and we need to take action now to preserve the space environment.\n",

Matplotlib and Plotly both provide 3D plotting functionality and are common libraries used in Python, although, matplotlib lacks the interactivity necessary to navigate a satellite orbit.  Because of this Plotly was first utilized.\n",
    "Plotly does have the capability for painting an image onto a 3D surface but only one color channel can be applied.  Also, since Plotly is utilizing functionality not designed to paint 3D surfaces with images, the image resolution must be kept at a minimum to improve performance.  In the end, a black and white, stereographic image of the earth was used to create an earth-like sphere.  To place a satellite marker on the Plotly 3D image, the Python package [`skyfield`](https://pypi.org/project/skyfield/) was used which offers the `EarthSatellite()` convenience function and outputs an x,y,z coordinate in kilometers with the center of the earth as the origin.\n",

    "One of the goals for the dashboard and the creation of the `satellite_czml` python package was to visualize all the satellites in orbit today using Cesium.  However, after assembling the pipeline to build and display the satellites, the amount of data proved to be too much and the visual was never able to load.  The amount of data necessary to plot over 20,000 satellites using a CZML string was slow and the amount of data too large for a timely response.  Using Javascript methods to calculate position instead of using CZML would have likely been a more suitable approach but this was abandoned in favor of using a 3D Plotly visual. Joined with Dash, the visual allows for the user to specify color coding and filtering options.\n",

    "In low Earth orbit, the velocity of a satellite is between 7 and 8 km/sec and the typical collision velocity between two space objects in LEO is around 10 km/sec. Most accidental LEO collisions are hypervelocity collisions. The deliberate destruction of a satellite with a launched missile is also a hypervelocity collision. A hypervelocity collision may be categorised as catastrophic or non-catastrophic. A catastrophic impact results in both the target and the impactor being totally destroyed while in a non-catastrophic event, the impactor is detroyed and the target is damaged.\n",
