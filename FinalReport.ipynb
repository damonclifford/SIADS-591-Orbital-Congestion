    "*Note to Team: this was copy pasted from our proposal*\n",
    "\n",
    "Space, and more specifically low-earth orbit, is about to get a whole lot busier and this is making many concerned.  At present, there are about 2,000 operational satellites in low-earth orbit and more than double that in defunct satellites.  But last year in October, SpaceX requested permission to launch 30,000 Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit.  This is in addition to the 12,000 that already received approval.  These satellites have already begun interrupting astronomical observations, creating light pollution and increasing collision risks in an environment where a collision could trigger a chain reaction which not only endangers current and future satellites but also human lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking into the present situation with satellite counts, ownership, purpose, and their corresponding orbits.  We will use visualization techniques such as spatial density charts, gabbard diagrams, and animated time series charts to illustrate orbital congestion and highlight intersecting orbits that have the potential for collision.  In addition to satellite data, we will explore debris in space.  Using this data, we intend to investigate several questions and present an analysis that can be used for future work."

    "<a id=\"av-history\"></a>\n",
    "### A. Satellite Congestion History\n",
    "In the past 60 years, the space around the Earth has gone from a virtually debris-free environment to a zone cluttered with man-made objects that potentially threaten launches, active satellites, and the International Space Station (ISS). Below time series graph illustrate the historical growth of space debris including rocket body as well as payload (i.e. satellite and spacecraft).\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of debris in orbit has been increasing since 1958. The rate of growth slowed for a decade from 1996. However, the destruction of the Fengyun-1C weather satellite in 2007 and the collision of the inactive Russian satellite Cosmos and the active U.S.-based communication satellite Iridium in 2009 reversed that trend, creating at least 4000 pieces of debris. As a result, it increased the risk of impacts to the ISS by an estimated 44 percent over a 10-day period[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1).\n",
    "\n",
    "![timeseries.PNG](images/timeseries.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to above time series analysis, the bar chart below provides another view on the number of space objects in different orbits. Evidently, low-earth orbit (LEO) has the highest objects count among all orbits stated. In 2020, approximately 80% of space objects are in LEO. LEO has become an orbital space junk yard. According to NASA, most “space junk” can reach a speed of 18,000 miles per hour, almost seven times faster than a bullet[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2). Due to the rate of speed and the increasing number of debris in LEO, current and future space-based activities pose a safety risk to people and property in space and on Earth. The problem of managing space debris is every spacefaring country's responsibility and we need to take action now to preserve the space environment.\n",

    "###  Collisions\n",
    "Collisions between objects in space are hypervelocity collisions where the velocity (v) of the impactor (relative to the target) is so great that its kinetic energy ( $K = \\frac{m v^2}{2}$) is greater than the energy released in the detonation of the same mass (m) of high explosive[<sup>3</sup>](#fn3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In low Earth orbit, the velocity of a satellite is between 7 and 8 km/sec and the typical collision velocity between two space objects in LEO is around 10 km/sec. Most accidental LEO collisions are hypervelocity collisions. The deliberate destruction of a satellite with a launched missile is also a hypervelocity collision. A hypervelocity collision may be categorised as catastrophic or non-catastrophic. A catastrophic impact results in both the target and the impactor being totally destroyed while in a non-catastrophic event, the impactor is detroyed and the target is damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment ejected from the collision will have a new orbit dependent upon the magnitude of the ejection velocity and the direction of this velocity vector with respect to the velocity vector of the satellite at the time of collision. If the velocity is in the same direction as the original target motion (A), the initial orbit will be turned into a larger elliptial orbit. On the other hand, if the velocity is in the opposite direction (B), the final orbit will become smaller than initail orbit. This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

    "### Gabbard Diagram\n",

    "### FengYun-1C Anti-satellite Missile Test\n",
    "On 11 January 2007, a non-operational Chinese weather satellite, the Fengyun-1C (FY-1C) was destroyed by a payload (a kinetic kill vehicle) traveling with a speed of 8 km/s in the opposite direction at an altitude of 863 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below Gabbard diagram illustrates the aftermath of this collision: \n",
    "1) 3526 pieces of debris of trackable sizes are documented and 646 have decayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The cross sign (x) marked the location of collision at the altitude of 863km which is low earth orbit(LEO). when a collision happens at a low altitude, some of the fragments ejected in the opposite direction to the original motion will be forced into orbits with a perigee below the Earth's surface. As a result, these fragments with smaller mass will generally burn up during reentry. Those of bigger mass tend to decay later due to atmospheric drag.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fragments with a perigee of less than about 100 km will encounter so much air resistance that they will never make it back to apogee, and will deorbit in less than one period. This explains the decay objects on the bottom left of the graph (purple and orange points) and the progessive drop in apogee as the period gets smaller.\n",
