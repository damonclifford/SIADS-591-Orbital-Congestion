    "# Downloading Space Track data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires account with Space Track\n",
    "* See `playground/tim_fetch/auto_fetch_all_payload_TLEs.ipynb` for code with auth\n",
    "* Create the `space-track-credentials.json` file from template with your own credentials\n",
    "* Limits on API - query size and date ranges are limited, for example, can't fetch all TLEs of a satellite easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated download\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted a way to automatically download huge batches of data files from Space Track.  For example, basically 2/3rds of the data needs to be downloaded to create the debris gabbard chart.  Problems:\n",
    "* Estimate that there are at least 100 million+ rows\n",
    "* API rate limit - 30 per minute and 300 per hour\n",
    "* Per request limit - figured to be around 25MB or 100,000 rows from previous trial and error\n",
    "* Cross-platform - we don't have a backend, we need a solution that works for Unix, Win and Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automation tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Fallback option: separate versions for Cron (Unix/Mac) and Windows Tasks scheduler (Win)\n",
    "* Cross-platform - do it from Jupyter Notebook!\n",
    "* Pros - if you can run notebook server, it'll work\n",
    "* Cons - you need to keep notebook open for the task to run, hopefully your browser doesn't crash :)\n",
    "* Use `IPython` javascript helpers, use %%html cell to render button to start/stop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turns out my connection speed with Space Track was too slow to reach API limits - manually running my cells intented for automation was sufficient to download all payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Skeleton code at `playground/tim_autorun-notebook/skeleton_autorun_below.ipynb`\n",
    "* Fetch all LEO payloads: `playground/tim_fetch/auto_fetch_all_payload_TLEs.ipynb`\n",
    "* Fetch all LEO debris: `playground/tim_fetch_debris/auto_fetch_all_debris_TLEs.ipynb`\n"
